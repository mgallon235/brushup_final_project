A sex ratio of 1.054688 would suggest that, on average, there are approximately 1.05 males for every female in the population. In that sense, a value below 1 indicates more females and a value above 1 indicates more males. As we can see from the mean of the 'Sex Ratio' column, there is more women than male in a 0.96 mean. As well, the correlation as we can see is strongly negative with a -0.49 value. This means that when the sex ratio decreases, the female population increases and most of the deaths are probably going to be women."
